# Base

The foundations of a rule.

## Name

The name is only used internally for you to better reference that rule. It isn't shown anywhere else than in this app.

## Topic

Topics are categories of events generated by your Shopify store. Whenever an event occur on your store an event is generated and Triggerify is able to perform diverse actions.

The events you're listening to will influence the payload you have access to, hence the filters and actions you can trigger.

The list of Shopify topics and their content can be looked up in the [Shopify documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/events/webhook) under "List of supported webhook events and topics".
