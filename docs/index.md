# Triggerify

Imagine being notified as soon as your inventory level drops below 5 items. Or to receive an SMS every time an important customer issues and order. Or have Shopify send a Slack message whenever someone buys for more than 500 dollars. With Triggerify, all of this and much more can become a reality.

## Rules

Rules are the base building block. It is how store events are consumed and turned into the desired actions.

A rule is constructed of 3 distinct segments:
- A [base](/)
- A list of [filters](/)
- A list of [actions](/)

With these blocks, it is possible to create the desired workflow that best suit your needs.

To help get started, [consult some of the examples](/).
