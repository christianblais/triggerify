# Triggerify

Imagine being notified as soon as your inventory level drops below 5 items. Or to receive an SMS every time an important customer issues and order. Or have Shopify send your company a Slack message whenever someone buys for more than 500 dollars. With Triggerify, all of this and much more can become a reality.

## Rule Creation

### Monitored topic

Topics are categories of events generated by your Shopify store. Whenever an event occur on your store an event is generated and Triggerify is able to perform diverse actions.

After giving it a name, a topic need to be selected. The list of Shopify topics and their content can be looked up in the [Shopify documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/events/webhook) under "List of supported webhook events and topics".

#### Name

The name is only used internally for you to better reference that rule. It isn't shown anywhere else than in this app.

#### Topic

The topic references one of the numerous Shopify webhooks. You can basically listen to anything, and act accordingly. The webhook you're listening to will influence the payload you have access to, hence the filters and actions you can trigger. Click [here](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/webhook) for additional details on available webhooks.

### Filters

Filters are optional. When the event match all filters or none are configured, actions will be performed.

#### Field

The field should be used to reference a particular snippet of the payload you'll want to compare with the value to determine if the rule should trigger or not. Those snippets change depending on the webhook you're listening to.

#### Verb

The verb represents the way we're going to compare the field with the value.

#### Value

For the filter to be valid, the evaluated field will need to match this value against the chosen verb.
