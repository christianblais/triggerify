Troubleshooting Shopify App
===========

### Generator shopify_app:install hangs

Rails uses spring by default to speed up development. To run the generator, spring has to be stopped:

```sh
$ bundle exec spring stop
```

Run shopify_app generator again.

### App installation fails with 'The page youâ€™re looking for could not be found' if the app was installed before

This issue can occur when the session (the model you set as `ShopifyApp::SessionRepository.storage`) isn't deleted when the user uninstalls your app. A possible fix for this is listening to the `app/uninstalled` webhook and deleting the corresponding session in the webhook handler.
